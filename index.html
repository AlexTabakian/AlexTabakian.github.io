      <h2>Problem statement: Crowded Public Spaces</h2>
        <p>
          University students do not know if a public space is crowded before they arrive there.

          We sorted our diagram by Profitability, Solutions, user feedback, requirements, and hurdles. We seperated it into these groups so we could break our brainstorming into seperate sections.

      <p>
        The persona I created was named Grandma Betty, she is a 90 year old grandma who is not very technology literate. She enjoys going to the pond to feed the ducks but it is always so 
        busy when she goes. A product that would let her know how busy the park is at a given time would benifiet her as she would know when and when not to go.

            <p>
              This storyboard follows the path of a Grandma using an app to confirm if a park is not busy before she leaves to go feed the ducks.
